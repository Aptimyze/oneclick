<h2>What is 1-Click?</h2>

<p>1-Click enables you to quickly and easily identify the most
appropriate options for making a trip by consolidating information about all of
the transportation services available in your area to present trip itineraries
tailored to you.</p>

<h2>How do I change the language of the application?</h2>

<p>You can change the language by clicking on the language
links in the lower left hand corner of the application. If you are a registered
user, you can also set a default language on your travel
profile.</p>

<h2>Where can I go for more information about the 1-Click initiative?</h2>

The <a href="/">home page</a> contains information and links to additional 1-Click information.

<h2>How can I get more
help with the use of 1-Click?
</h2>

<p>Contact the 1-Click team via <a href="mailto:1-click@camsys.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a
registered user, you can also get assistance planning trips and managing your account.</p>

<a id="tripplanning"><h1 class="target">Trip Planning</h1></a>

<p>The Trip Planning workflow (Trip &rarr; Options &rarr; Review &rarr; Plan) allows you
to plan a trip including from and to location, dates/times, transportation
modes, eligibility and required accommodations. Based on the entered
information, potential trip itineraries are displayed allowing you to select
the most appropriate.</p>

<a id="trip"><h2 class="target">Trip</h2></a>

<p>The "Trip" planning page is where you enter the details of the
trip that you want to take. For example, where you are going, when you are
going, what modes of transportation you would consider taking.</p>

<h3>What transportation modes can I plan trips using?</h3>

<p>1-Click
plans trips using the following modes of transportation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bike</li>
<li>Drive</li>
<li>Paratransit: demand-response and volunteer services</li>
<li>Rideshare: Carpool and vanpool options</li>
<li>Taxi: Local taxi services</li>
<li>Transit: local regular schedule bus and rail services</li>
<li>Walk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why do I need to give the purpose of my trip?</h3>

<p>Some services only provide trips for certain purposes, such
as medical visits or grocery trips. Giving the purpose of your trip allows 1-Click
to determine whether you are eligible for those trip itineraries.</p>

<h3>How do I set the from and to locations of my trip?</h3>

<p>The from and to locations can be defined by typing an
address, a place of interest or a saved place and selecting the appropriate
item from the list. Alternatively, you can use the flag tool to select a
location on the map.
</p>

<h3>I have a place that I will be traveling to/from frequently. Is
there a way for me to save it?</h3>

<p>If you register for an account, you
can save your frequently used places for easy reuse.</p>

<a id="options"><h2 class="target">Options</h2></a>

<p>Some trip itineraries may
only be available if you meet certain eligibility criteria (e.g., age,
disability status, trip type), and there may be certain accommodations (e.g.,
door-to-door service, need to travel with a folding wheelchair) you need. The
Options page within the Trip Planning workflow allows you to define (or not)
your eligibility and your required accommodations.
</p>

<h3>Why was the Options page not shown as part of the workflow?</h3>

<p>The Options page is only displayed if you requested
Paratransit as a transportation mode on the Trip page.
</p>

<h3>Why do I need to answer these questions?</h3>

<p>The questions help determine your eligibility
for certain specialized services, and ask about any accommodations that you
might need. Your answers are used to determine the Paratransit services meet
your needs.
</p>

<h3>What happens if I don't answer the questions?</h3>

<p>If you do not answer the eligibility questions on this page
and 1-Click finds a trip option with a Paratransit service that has eligibility
requirements, you will be required to answer any relevant questions before you
are able to select that trip.
</p>

<p>If you do not answer questions about necessary
accommodations, 1-Click will not be able to tell you if a service might be unable
to meet your needs.</p>

<a id="review"><h2 class="target">Review</h2></a>

<p>Based on the entered trip information, multiple trip
itineraries are displayed for the outbound and return (if return trip
requested) legs of the trip.
</p>

<h3>How can I see more details about a displayed trip itinerary?</h3>

<p>To see a summary of the trip itinerary, on a desktop
computer hover the mouse point over the displayed trip itinerary colored bar or
on a touchscreen device tap the bar.
</p>

<p>To see the full details of the trip itinerary, on a desktop
computer click the displayed trip itinerary colored bar or on a touchscreen
device double-tap the bar.
</p>

<h3>I only want to see certain kinds of trips--how can I hide the
ones that I'm not interested in?
</h3>

<p>On the left side of the Review page, you can filter the trip
itineraries by mode of transportation, number of transfers, trip cost and trip
time.</p>

<h3>How do I select the outbound and return trip itineraries?</h3>

<p>Click the "Select" button to the right of the chosen
outbound and return trip itineraries.
</p>

<h3>Why do some trip itineraries have question marks instead of Select
buttons?</h3>

<p>If a Paratransit service used for a specific trip itinerary has
eligibility requirements and you have not answered the relevant questions
either on the Options page or on your travel
profile (for registered users), you will have to answer those questions by
clicking on the "?" button to the right of the trip itinerary before you can
proceed with selecting that trip itinerary.
</p>

<h3>What do I do if my trip returns no itineraries/ no itineraries
that will work for me?
</h3>

<p>You can use the "Feedback" button in the upper right of the
page to send feedback about trips that don't turn up any satisfactory itineraries.
</p>

<h3>I want to change something about my trip or my answers to the
questions. How can I do this?
</h3>

<p>Under the logo in the upper left of the page, there are
breadcrumb links that will take you back to each step in the trip planning
process allowing you to make edits and replan your trip.
</p>

<a id="plan"><h2 class="target">Plan</h2></a>

<p>The Plan page displays the details of the selected trip,

do this?</h3>

<p>Trips can be booked by contacting the service"s provider.
</p>

<h3>How can I save this trip so that I can plan it again?</h3>

with 1-Click, all trips that you plan are automatically saved to "My Trips", accessible when you log in.
